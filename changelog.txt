v0.2-dev1 2025-10-31
- added: New Candy Bag Interaction: You now hold the right mouse button to open a candy bag.
- added: Patch for remapping candy and candybag items. All old candybags cannot be remmapped to new candybag, so you SHOULD OPEN THEM before if you don't want to lose them.
- changed: Candy Bag Rework: All previous candy bag variants have been merged into a single, generic candybag item. Each bag now drops a random amount (1-3) of a random candy type upon being opened.
--------------------------------------------
Technical Notes
- The consumable, variant-based candy bag system has been replaced by a single item using a custom OpenBagBehavior C# class to handle the held-interaction.
