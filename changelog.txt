v1.0.1 2025-11-25


v1.0.0 2025-11-22 - The Spectral Weakness

New Content & Mechanics:
- Added: Spectral Resistance mechanic (Vanilla weapons deal -50% damage to spectral mobs).
- Added: 1 new metal (Spectrium) and 2 alloys (Etherium, Aetherium) to bypass resistance.
- Added: New weapon type: Warscythe.
- Added: New sound effects and visual effects for spectral creatures.

Configuration:
- Added: `AllowedCandyMonths` config option. Defines exactly which months candy bags can drop (e.g., [10] for October). Replaces the old boolean `HalloweenEventOnly`.
- Added: `CandyOnlyOnFullMoon` config option. When enabled, candy bags only drop on Full Moon nights.

Updates & Balancing:
- Updated: Spooky Candy mechanics, visual effects, and UI tooltips.
- Tweaked: Spectral creature spawn rates and loot tables.
- Tweaked: Balancing for spectral-themed weapons.

Technical & Fixes:
- Improved: Config migration system. The mod now automatically converts settings and deletes legacy config files (v0.2.0) to keep the folder clean.
- Fixed: Candy loot logic to support multiple allowed months.
- Fixed: Various bugs related to spectral creatures and candy loot.

v0.2.0 2025-11-06
- Added: Configuration file for advanced mod customization.
- Added: Spectral creatures are now unique entities, not just patches on vanilla mobs.
- Added: Option to enable/disable pumpkin smoke via config.
- Added: Option to enable/disable the CandyLoot system via config.
- Changed: Overhauled the loot system.
- Changed: Overhauled the spawn system (now based on a defined period).

v0.2-dev1 2025-10-31
- added: New Candy Bag Interaction: You now hold the right mouse button to open a candy bag.
- added: Patch for remapping candy and candybag items. All old candybags cannot be remmapped to new candybag, so you SHOULD OPEN THEM before if you don't want to lose them.
- changed: Candy Bag Rework: All previous candy bag variants have been merged into a single, generic candybag item. Each bag now drops a random amount (1-3) of a random candy type upon being opened.
--------------------------------------------
Technical Notes
- The consumable, variant-based candy bag system has been replaced by a single item using a custom OpenBagBehavior C# class to handle the held-interaction.
