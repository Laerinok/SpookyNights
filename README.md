# Spooky Nights

**Spooky Nights** is a thematic overhaul mod for Vintage Story that introduces a supernatural threat to your world. The night is no longer just dark; it is resistant to your steel. To survive, you must adapt, learn spectral metallurgy, and embrace the chaos of Halloween.

## ?? Key Features

### 1. Spectral Resistance System
Ghosts and spectral entities in this mod are not made of flesh.
*   **The Resistance:** Ordinary weapons (Copper, Iron, Steel) deal **-50% Damage** to spectral enemies.
*   **The Solution:** You must craft weapons using **Spectrium** and its alloys to bypass this resistance.
    *   **Spectrium:** Deals normal damage (100%).
    *   **Etherium:** Deals **+20%** Bonus Damage.
    *   **Aetherium:** Deals **+40%** Bonus Damage.

### 2. New Metallurgy & Weapons
Harvest **Spectral Hearts** from fallen spirits to forge new gear.
*   **The War Scythe:** A new polearm with a massive **3.2m range**, allowing you to strike dangerous entities from a safe distance. Heavy to hold, but deadly.
*   **Spectral Arsenal:** Craft Falx blades, Spears, and Arrows using the new alloys.
*   **Alloys:**
    *   *Etherium:* A durable blend of Copper and Spectrium.
    *   *Aetherium:* The ultimate ghost-hunting metal, fused with Bismuth and Silver.

### 3. Trick or Treat
Loot **Candy Bags** and discover 5 unique candies with "Double-Edged" effects.
*   **Spider Gummy:** Grants super-jump but poisons you.
*   **Ghost Caramel:** Restores stability but makes you physically weak.
*   **Vampire Teeth:** Heals deeply but tires you (Mining Fatigue).
*   **Mummy Candy:** Makes you immovable (Knockback resist) but slow.
*   **Shadow Cube:** A chaos item. It might fully heal and feed you, or blind you and teleport you into a cobweb. Eat at your own risk!

### 4. The Spectral Bestiary
Face new variants of Drifters, Wolves, Bears, and Archers that glow in the dark and require specific strategies to defeat.
